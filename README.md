👋 Introduction

This repository contains a simple React app that allows users to enter their first name, last name and email address. The app is designed to demonstrate how to use React Hooks to manage state and update the UI in real-time.

🚀 Getting Started

The app uses CSS to style the UI. 

The background is a gradient that changes colors over time, and there are three waves 🌊🌊🌊 at the bottom of the screen that move back and forth to create a dynamic effect.

Happy coding! 💻🎉
